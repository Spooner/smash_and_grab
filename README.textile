* The game was developed by Spooner (Bil Bas) bil.bagpuss@gmail.com

h2. Description

_Smash and Grab!_ is a retro isometric supervillainous turn-based hiest game.

h2. Requirements

h3. Windows

If running <tt>smash_and_grab.exe</tt>, there are no other requirements.

h3. OS X

If running OS X 10.6, use the executable (<tt>SmashAndGrab.app</tt>), which has no dependencies. If not, the only option is running from source (details below).

NOTE: OS X app is NOT made yet.

h3. Source for Linux (or Windows/OS X if not using the executable)

If running from source, users must install the Ruby interpreter and some rubygems. Linux users must also install some "extra dependencies":https://github.com/jlnr/gosu/wiki/Getting-Started-on-Linux for Gosu.

h4. Dependencies

* Ruby 1.9.2 (Install via package manager or rvm). Ruby 1.9.3 recommended though, since loading is significantly faster.
** Gosu gem 0.7.32 (Dependencies: "Linux only":https://github.com/jlnr/gosu/wiki/Getting-Started-on-Linux)
** A number of other rubygems, which can be installed automatically using Bundler (see below).
** Linux Only: <tt>xsel</tt> or <tt>xcopy</tt> command to allow access to the system clipboard:
<pre>    sudo apt-get install xsel</pre>

h4. Using Bundler to install gems

If the Bundler gem isn't already installed, that can be installed with:

<pre>
    gem install bundler --no-ri --no-rdoc
</pre>

In the game's main directory (with <tt>Gemfile</tt> in it), use Bundler to automatically install the correct gem versions:

<pre>
    bundle install
</pre>

h4. Running the game

May need to use <tt>ruby19</tt> rather than <tt>ruby</tt>. Depends how you installed Ruby 1.9.2!

<pre>
    ruby bin/smash_and_grab.rbw
</pre>

h2. How to Play

Move your supervillains around until you win.
